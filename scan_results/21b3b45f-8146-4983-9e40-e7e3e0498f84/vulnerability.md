### Nikto Analysis


### Issue Explanation
Nikto identified a server header vulnerability. The server header is a response header that contains information about the server software and version. This information can be used by attackers to identify known vulnerabilities or to craft targeted attacks.

The root cause of this vulnerability is typically misconfiguration of the web server, such as not setting the `Server` header to a generic value or not using a custom `Server` header.

### Impact Analysis
The direct technical consequences of this vulnerability are:
- It allows attackers to identify the version of the web server and installed software, which can be used to find known vulnerabilities.
- It can lead to further exploitation, as attackers can use the information to craft targeted attacks or to find other vulnerabilities.
- It can reveal sensitive information about the server and its configuration.

### Exploitation Details & Proof-of-Concept
An attacker might take the following steps to exploit this vulnerability:
1. Make a request to the web server and analyze the server header to identify the version of the server and installed software.
2. Use the information to search for known vulnerabilities associated with the identified version.
3. Craft targeted attacks or use known exploits to exploit the identified vulnerabilities.

Here is a simple command-line example using `curl` to demonstrate the vulnerability:
```
curl -I http://example.com
```
This command sends an HTTP GET request and displays the HTTP headers, including the server header, which may reveal the server version if the server is misconfigured.

### Step-by-Step Remediation & Verification
To fix this vulnerability, you need to configure the web server to remove or obscure the server header. Here are the steps for Apache and Nginx:

#### Apache
1. Open the Apache configuration file (e.g., `httpd.conf` or `.htaccess`).
2. Add the following lines to the configuration:
   ```
   ServerSignature Off
   ServerTokens Prod
   ```
   The `ServerSignature Off` directive disables the display of the server version in the server header. The `ServerTokens Prod` directive sets the server header to a generic value.
3. Save the configuration file and restart the Apache server.
4. To verify the fix, make a request to the web server and check if the server header is no longer present or is set to a generic value.

#### Nginx
1. Open the Nginx configuration file (e.g., `nginx.conf`).
2. Add the following lines to the configuration:
   ```
   server_tokens off;
   ```
   The `server_tokens off;` directive disables the display of the server version in the server header.
3. Save the configuration file and restart the Nginx server.
4. To verify the fix, make a request to the web server and check if the server header is no longer present or is set to a generic value.
