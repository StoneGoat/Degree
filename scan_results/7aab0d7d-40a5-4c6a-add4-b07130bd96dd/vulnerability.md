## Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens

### Issue Explanation
The absence of anti-CSRF tokens in HTML submission forms can be a significant security vulnerability. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. This is done by tricking the user into submitting a request to the application, which the application then processes as if it were from the user.

In the context of HTTP headers, CSRF attacks can be executed by an attacker embedding a malicious link or form in a website that the victim visits. When the victim clicks the link or submits the form, the browser sends a request to the target application, which the application processes as if it were from the victim.

Without anti-CSRF tokens, the application cannot differentiate between legitimate requests from the victim and malicious requests from an attacker. This can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the victim, such as changing account information, transferring funds, or executing other sensitive operations.

### Impact Analysis
The impact of CSRF without anti-CSRF tokens can be severe, including:

1. **Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers can perform actions on behalf of the victim without their knowledge, leading to unauthorized changes to their account or data.

2. **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate data, such as changing account information, transferring funds, or executing other sensitive operations.

3. **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can hijack the victim's session by tricking them into submitting a malicious request, allowing the attacker to access the victim's account.

4. **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can use CSRF to trick users into submitting sensitive information to a malicious site, which can then be used for further attacks.

5. **Data Breach:** If the application processes sensitive data, CSRF can be used to exfiltrate this data without the victim's knowledge.

### Exploitation Details
To exploit CSRF without anti-CSRF tokens, attackers can:

1. **Craft Malicious Links:** Attackers can create links that point to the target application, tricking the victim into clicking them.

2. **Embed Malicious Forms:** Attackers can embed forms in a website that the victim visits, tricking them into submitting the form.

3. **Use of Reflected XSS:** If the application is vulnerable to reflected XSS, attackers can inject CSRF tokens into the response, allowing them to bypass the CSRF protection.

4. **Automated Tools:** Tools like BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) can be used to automate the process of creating and delivering CSRF attacks.

### Step-by-Step Remediation
To remediate CSRF without anti-CSRF tokens, you can:

1. **Server-Side Validation:** Implement server-side validation to ensure that the request is coming from a legitimate source.

2. **Use of Anti-CSRF Tokens:** Generate and include anti-CSRF tokens in forms and links, and validate them on the server-side.

3. **Use of CSRF Protection Libraries:** Use libraries like OWASP CSRFGuard or the OWASP ESAPI to implement CSRF protection.

4. **Use of HTTPS:** Ensure that the application uses HTTPS to prevent attackers from intercepting and modifying requests.

5. **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of CSRF and how to recognize and avoid malicious links and forms.

## Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set

### Issue Explanation
The vulnerability in question is related to the absence of the Content Security Policy (CSP) header in the HTTP response. CSP is a security feature that helps protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks by specifying which dynamic resources are allowed to load on a page.

The CSP header is used to define a whitelist of trusted sources for various types of resources, such as JavaScript, CSS, images, and more. By specifying the allowed sources, the browser can enforce the policy and prevent the execution of malicious scripts or the loading of malicious resources.

### Impact Analysis
The absence of the CSP header can have the following security implications:

1. **Increased Risk of XSS Attacks:** Without a CSP, the browser has no way to enforce the security policy, making it easier for attackers to inject malicious scripts into the page.

2. **Lack of Protection Against Data Injection Attacks:** CSP helps prevent data injection attacks by specifying which sources are allowed to load data into the page.

3. **Potential for Phishing and Malware Distribution:** Attackers can use the lack of CSP to inject malicious scripts or resources that can be used for phishing or malware distribution.

4. **Lack of Granular Control Over Resources:** Without CSP, there is no way to control which resources are loaded on the page, leading to a less secure environment.

### Exploitation Details
Attackers can exploit the absence of CSP by:

1. **Injecting Malicious Scripts:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the page, which can be executed by the browser without any restrictions.

2. **Loading Malicious Resources:** Attackers can load malicious resources, such as images or iframes, which can be used to execute attacks or distribute malware.

3. **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Attackers can use the lack of CSP to craft phishing emails or social engineering attacks that appear more convincing.

### Step-by-Step Remediation
To remediate this vulnerability, you can set the CSP header on your web server or application server. Here are some examples for different platforms:

1. **Apache HTTP Server:**
   - Add the following directive to your `.htaccess` file or `httpd.conf` file:
     ```
     Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src'self'; script-src'self'; style-src'self';"
     ```
   - Replace `'self'` with the appropriate sources you want to allow.

2. **Nginx:**
   - Add the following directive to your `nginx.conf` file:
     ```
     add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src'self'; script-src'self'; style-src'self';";
     ```
   - Replace `'self'` with the appropriate sources you want to allow.

3. **IIS:**
   - Add the following directive to your `web.config` file:
     ```
     <system.webServer>
       <httpProtocol>
         <customHeaders>
           <add name="Content-Security-Policy" value="default-src'self'; script-src'self'; style-src'self';" />
         </customHeaders>
       </httpProtocol>
     </system.webServer>
     ```
   - Replace `'self'` with the appropriate sources you want to allow.

4. **Express.js:**
   - Use the `helmet` middleware to set the CSP header:
     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const helmet = require('helmet');
     const app = express();

     app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
       useDefaults: true,
       directives: {
         defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
         scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
         styleSrc: ["'self'"]
       }
     }));
     ```
   - Replace `'self'` with the appropriate sources you want to allow.

5. **PHP:**
   - Use the `header()` function to set the CSP header in your PHP code:
     ```php
     header("Content-Security-Policy: default-src'self'; script-src'self'; style-src'self';");
     ```
   - Replace `'self'` with the appropriate sources you want to allow.

## Missing Anti-clickjacking Header

### Issue Explanation
The vulnerability in question is related to the absence of anti-clickjacking headers in the HTTP response. Clickjacking is a type of attack where an attacker tricks a user into clicking on a malicious link or button that appears to be part of a legitimate website. This can lead to the user unknowingly performing actions on the attacker's behalf, such as logging into their account or downloading malware.

The HTTP headers `Content-Security-Policy` and `X-Frame-Options` are used to protect against clickjacking attacks. The `Content-Security-Policy` header allows you to specify which domains are allowed to load resources (like scripts, images, etc.) on your page, while the `X-Frame-Options` header controls whether the page can be displayed in a frame or not.

### Impact Analysis
The absence of these headers can have the following security implications:

1. **Clickjacking Attacks:** Attackers can embed the vulnerable page in an iframe on a malicious website and trick users into clicking on it, leading to unauthorized actions being performed on the user's behalf.

2. **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Attackers can use clickjacking to trick users into performing actions on malicious websites that appear to be legitimate, leading to data theft or account compromise.

3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can use clickjacking to bypass XSS protections by tricking users into executing malicious scripts.

4. **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can use clickjacking to hijack user sessions by tricking users into clicking on a malicious link that appears to be part of a legitimate website.

### Exploitation Details
Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by:

1. **Embedding the Target Page:** The attacker can embed the vulnerable page in an iframe on a malicious website. When a user visits the malicious website, they will see the vulnerable page in the iframe, and any actions they perform on the page will be performed on the attacker's behalf.

2. **Tricking Users:** The attacker can use social engineering techniques to trick users into clicking on the malicious link or button, leading to the execution of the attacker's code.

3. **Automated Attacks:** Tools like BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) can be used to automate the process of embedding the vulnerable page and tricking users into performing actions.

### Step-by-Step Remediation
To remediate this vulnerability, you can:

1. **Server-Level Remediation:**
   - **Apache:** Set the `X-Frame-Options` header to `SAMEORIGIN` or `DENY` to prevent the page from being framed. For example:
     ```
     Header set X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN
     ```
   - **Nginx:** Set the `X-Frame-Options` header to `SAMEORIGIN` or `DENY` to prevent the page from being framed. For example:
     ```
     add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
     ```
   - **IIS:** Set the `X-Frame-Options` header to `SAMEORIGIN` or `DENY` to prevent the page from being framed. For example:
     ```
     <system.webServer>
       <httpProtocol>
         <customHeaders>
           <add name="X-Frame-Options" value="SAMEORIGIN" />
         </customHeaders>
       </httpProtocol>
     </system.webServer>
     ```

2. **Application-Level Remediation:**
   - **Express.js:** Use the `frameguard` middleware to set the `X-Frame-Options` header. For example:
     ```javascript
     app.use(require('frameguard')());
     ```
   - **PHP:** Use the `header` function to set the `X-Frame-Options` header. For example:
     ```php
     header('X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN');
     ```

## Cookie without SameSite Attribute

### Issue Explanation
The vulnerability in question is related to the absence of the SameSite attribute in a cookie. The SameSite attribute is a browser-side policy that helps mitigate the risk of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by controlling the contexts in which a cookie is sent.

Cookies without the SameSite attribute can be sent as a result of a 'cross-site' request, which can lead to security issues. For example, if an attacker tricks a user into visiting a malicious website, the attacker can potentially access the cookie and perform actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

### Impact Analysis
The impact of not setting the SameSite attribute can be significant:

1. **CSRF Attacks:** Attackers can perform CSRF attacks by tricking users into visiting a malicious website that sends a request to the server with the cookie, allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user.

2. **XSS Attacks:** Attackers can perform XSS attacks by injecting malicious scripts into the page, which can access the cookie and perform actions on behalf of the user.

3. **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can hijack user sessions by stealing the cookie and using it to impersonate the user.

4. **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive data stored in the cookie, leading to a data breach.

### Exploitation Details
Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by:

1. **Phishing:** Sending phishing emails or links to users that trick them into visiting a malicious website.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into the page that can access the cookie.
3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Tricking users into performing actions on behalf of the attacker.

### Step-by-Step Remediation
To remediate this vulnerability, you can set the SameSite attribute to 'lax' or'strict' for all cookies. Here's how you can do it for different platforms:

1. **Server-Level Remediation:**
   - **Apache:** Set the `SameSite` directive in the `Set-Cookie` header. For example:
     ```
     Set-Cookie: mycookie=value; SameSite=Lax
     ```
   - **Nginx:** Set the `same_site` directive in the `add_header` directive. For example:
     ```
     add_header Set-Cookie mycookie=value; SameSite=Lax;
     ```
   - **IIS:** Set the `SameSite` attribute in the `Set-Cookie` header. For example:
     ```
     Set-Cookie: mycookie=value; SameSite=Lax
     ```

2. **Application-Level Remediation:**
   - **Express.js:** Set the `SameSite` attribute in the `res.cookie()` method. For example:
     ```javascript
     res.cookie('mycookie', 'value', { sameSite: 'Lax' });
     ```
   - **PHP:** Set the `SameSite` attribute in the `setcookie()` function. For example:
     ```php
     setcookie('mycookie', 'value', ['SameSite' => 'Lax']);
     ```

## X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing

### Issue Explanation
The vulnerability in question is related to the absence of the X-Content-Type-Options header, which is a security feature that can prevent MIME-sniffing attacks. MIME-sniffing is a technique used by some web browsers to guess the content type of a response based on the content of the response body, which can lead to security issues.

The X-Content-Type-Options header is used to instruct the browser to not perform MIME-sniffing on the response body. When this header is set to 'nosniff', it tells the browser to use the declared content type in the Content-Type header, rather than guessing it based on the response body.

### Impact Analysis
The absence of the X-Content-Type-Options header can have the following security implications:

1. **MIME-Sniffing Attacks:** Attackers can exploit the absence of this header to perform MIME-sniffing attacks, where they guess the content type of the response body and serve malicious content that is interpreted as a different type, leading to security issues.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the content type is guessed incorrectly, it can lead to XSS attacks, where malicious scripts are executed in the context of the website.

3. **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Attackers can use the absence of the X-Content-Type-Options header to serve phishing content that appears as a different type, making it more convincing to the user.

4. **Data Leakage:** If the content type is guessed incorrectly, it can lead to data leakage, where sensitive information is exposed to the attacker.

### Exploitation Details
Attackers can exploit the absence of the X-Content-Type-Options header by:

1. **MIME-Sniffing:** Using tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to intercept and analyze the HTTP traffic, and then serving malicious content that is interpreted as a different type.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into the response body and relying on the browser to interpret the content as a different type, leading to XSS.

3. **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Crafting phishing emails or social engineering attacks that serve content that appears as a different type, making it more convincing to the user.

### Step-by-Step Remediation
To remediate this vulnerability, you can take the following steps:

1. **Server-Level Remediation:**
   - **Apache:** Set the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' in the server configuration. For example:
     ```
     Header set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
     ```
   - **Nginx:** Set the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' in the server configuration. For example:
     ```
     add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
     ```
   - **IIS:** Set the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' in the server configuration. For example:
     ```
     <system.webServer>
       <httpProtocol>
         <customHeaders>
           <add name="X-Content-Type-Options" value="nosniff" />
         </customHeaders>
       </httpProtocol>
     </system.webServer>
     ```

2. **Application-Level Remediation:**
   - **Express.js:** Set the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' in the application code. For example:
     ```javascript
     app.use((req, res, next) => {
       res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
       next();
     });
     ```
   - **PHP:** Set the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' in the application code. For example:
     ```php
     header('X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff');
     ```

1. **Fingerprinting:** Attackers can use the server version information to fingerprint the server and identify its exact version, which can be used to tailor further attacks.

2. **Version Enumeration:** Attackers can enumerate the exact version of the server software, which can be used to identify known vulnerabilities associated with that version.

3. **Combining with Other Reconnaissance Techniques:** The server version information can be combined with other reconnaissance techniques, such as directory traversal, to gather more information about the server and its configuration.

4. **Targeted Attacks:** Attackers can use the server version information to craft targeted attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities specific to the identified version of the server software.

5. **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Attackers can use the server version information to create more convincing phishing emails or social engineering attacks, as they can tailor the attack to appear more legitimate.

### Exploitation Details
To exploit this vulnerability, attackers can use various techniques such as:

1. **Automated Scanning:** Tools like Nmap, OWASP ZAP, or Burp Suite can be used to scan the target server and extract the server version information from the `Server` header.

2. **Manual Analysis:** Attackers can manually inspect the HTTP headers in the response from the server to identify the server version.

3. **Automated Header Collection:** Tools like `curl` or `wget` can be used to fetch the headers from the server and extract the server version information.

Here's an example of how to use `curl` to collect headers and extract the server version:

```bash
curl -I http://example.com
```

This command will fetch the headers from the server and display them. The server version information can be found in the `Server` header.

### Step-by-Step Remediation
To remediate this vulnerability, you can take the following steps:

1. **Server-Level Remediation:**
   - **Apache:** Set the `ServerTokens` directive to a minimal value to reduce the amount of information disclosed in the `Server` header. For example:
     ```
     ServerTokens Prod
     ```
   - **Nginx:** Set the `server_tokens` directive to `off` to disable the disclosure of server version information. For example:
     ```
     server_tokens off;
     ```
   - **IIS:** Set the `ServerHeader` directive to `off` to disable the disclosure of server version information. For example:
     ```
     <system.webServer>
       <serverRuntime serverHeader="off" />
     </system.webServer>
     ```

2. **Application-Level Remediation:**
   - **Express.js:** Use the `trust proxy` middleware to set the `X-Forwarded-For` header, which can be used to hide the server version information. For example:
     ```javascript
     app.use(require('express').trustProxy());
     ```
   - **PHP:** Use the `apache2handler` module to set the `ServerSignature` directive to `Off` to disable the disclosure of server version information. For example:
     ```
     php_value serverSignature Off
     ```

## Cookie Without Secure Flag

### Issue Explanation
The vulnerability in question is related to the absence of the `Secure` flag in a cookie. This can be a significant security issue because it allows the cookie to be transmitted over unencrypted channels, such as HTTP, which can be intercepted by attackers.

Cookies are small pieces of data sent from a server to a user's browser and stored on the client-side. The `Secure` flag is a directive that tells the browser to only send the cookie over HTTPS connections, ensuring that the cookie is transmitted securely.

When a cookie is set without the `Secure` flag, it can be accessed via unencrypted HTTP connections, which can be intercepted by attackers. This can lead to the following security implications:

1. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Attackers can intercept the unencrypted cookie and potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's session or sensitive information.

2. **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can hijack the user's session by stealing the cookie and using it to impersonate the user.

3. **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Attackers can use the cookie to create more convincing phishing emails or social engineering attacks, as they can use the stolen cookie to impersonate the user.

### Impact Analysis
The impact of not setting the `Secure` flag on cookies can be severe. It can lead to the following security implications:

1. **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Sensitive information stored in the cookie can be exposed to attackers, leading to data breaches.

2. **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can hijack user sessions, allowing them to access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.

3. **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Attackers can use the cookie to impersonate users, leading to further attacks.

4. **Lack of Confidentiality:** The lack of encryption can lead to a lack of confidentiality, as the cookie can be intercepted and read by anyone on the network.

### Exploitation Details
To exploit this vulnerability, attackers can use various techniques such as:

1. **Intercepting Unencrypted Traffic:** Attackers can intercept unencrypted HTTP traffic to capture the cookie.

2. **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can use the intercepted cookie to hijack the user's session.

3. **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Attackers can use the cookie to impersonate the user in phishing emails or social engineering attacks.

### Step-by-Step Remediation
To remediate this vulnerability, you can take the following steps:

1. **Server-Level Remediation:**
   - **Apache:** Set the `Secure` flag for cookies using the `Set-Cookie` directive. For example:
     ```
     Set-Cookie: mycookie=value; Secure
     ```
   - **Nginx:** Set the `secure` parameter for cookies using the `add_header` directive. For example:
     ```
     add_header Set-Cookie mycookie=value; Secure;
     ```
   - **IIS:** Set the `Secure` flag for cookies using the `Set-Cookie` directive. For example:
     ```
     Set-Cookie: mycookie=value; Secure
     ```

2. **Application-Level Remediation:**
   - **Express.js:** Set the `secure` option for cookies using the `cookie` middleware. For example:
     ```javascript
     app.use(cookieParser({ secure: true }));
     ```
   - **PHP:** Set the `secure` parameter for cookies using the `setcookie` function. For example:
     ```php
     setcookie('mycookie', 'value', time() + (86400 * 30), '/', 'example.com', true, true);
     ```

## Cookie without SameSite Attribute

### Issue Explanation
The vulnerability in question is related to the absence of the SameSite attribute in a cookie. The SameSite attribute is a browser-side policy that helps mitigate the risk of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by controlling the contexts in which a cookie is sent.

Cookies without the SameSite attribute can be sent as a result of a 'cross-site' request, which can lead to security issues. For example, if an attacker tricks a user into visiting a malicious website, the attacker can potentially access the cookie and perform actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

### Impact Analysis
The impact of not setting the SameSite attribute can be significant:

1. **CSRF Attacks:** Attackers can perform CSRF attacks by tricking users into visiting a malicious website that sends a request to the server with the cookie, allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user.

2. **XSS Attacks:** Attackers can perform XSS attacks by injecting malicious scripts into the page, which can access the cookie and perform actions on behalf of the user.

3. **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can hijack user sessions by stealing the cookie and using it to impersonate the user.

4. **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive data stored in the cookie, leading to a data breach.

### Exploitation Details
Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by:

1. **Phishing:** Sending phishing emails or links to users that trick them into visiting a malicious website.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into the page that can access the cookie.
3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Tricking users into performing actions on behalf of the attacker by sending requests with the cookie.

### Step-by-Step Remediation
To remediate this vulnerability, you can set the SameSite attribute to 'lax' or'strict' for all cookies. Here's how you can do it for different platforms:

1. **Server-Level Remediation:**
   - **Apache:** Set the `SameSite` directive in the `Set-Cookie` header. For example:
     ```
     Set-Cookie: mycookie=value; SameSite=lax
     ```
   - **Nginx:** Set the `same_site` directive in the `add_header` directive. For example:
     ```
     add_header Set-Cookie mycookie=value; SameSite=lax;
     ```
   - **IIS:** Set the `SameSite` attribute in the `Set-Cookie` header. For example:
     ```
     Set-Cookie: mycookie=value; SameSite=lax
     ```

2. **Application-Level Remediation:**
   - **Express.js:** Set the `SameSite` attribute in the `res.cookie()` method. For example:
     ```javascript
     res.cookie('mycookie', 'value', { sameSite: 'lax' });
     ```
   - **PHP:** Set the `SameSite` attribute in the `setcookie()` function. For example:
     ```php
     setcookie('mycookie', 'value', ['SameSite' => 'lax']);
     ```

## Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set

### Issue Explanation
The vulnerability in question is related to the absence of the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header. HSTS is a security feature that helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. It forces the client to communicate with the server over HTTPS only, even if the initial connection was made over HTTP.

The HSTS header is sent by the server to the client and instructs the client to only communicate with the server over HTTPS. This ensures that the connection is encrypted and prevents attackers from intercepting and tampering with the communication.

### Impact Analysis
The absence of the HSTS header can have the following security implications:

1. **Protocol Downgrade Attacks:** Attackers can intercept the initial HTTP connection and redirect the client to a malicious site, potentially leading to a man-in-the-middle attack.

2. **Cookie Hijacking:** Attackers can intercept and steal cookies that are not marked as secure, leading to session hijacking.

3. **Mixed Content Issues:** The absence of HSTS can lead to mixed content issues, where the client loads resources over HTTP instead of HTTPS, potentially exposing sensitive information.

4. **Bypassing Security Mechanisms:** Attackers can bypass security mechanisms that rely on the presence of the HSTS header, such as browser security warnings for non-HTTPS sites.

### Exploitation Details
Attackers can exploit the absence of the HSTS header by:

1. **Intercepting Initial Connections:** Attackers can intercept the initial HTTP connection and redirect the client to a malicious site, potentially leading to a man-in-the-middle attack.

2. **Stealing Cookies:** Attackers can steal cookies that are not marked as secure, leading to session hijacking.

3. **Bypassing Security Warnings:** Attackers can bypass browser security warnings for non-HTTPS sites, as the absence of the HSTS header does not trigger these warnings.

### Step-by-Step Remediation
To remediate this vulnerability, you can take the following steps:

1. **Server-Level Remediation:**
   - **Apache:** Set the `Header always set Strict-Transport-Security` directive to enforce HSTS. For example:
     ```
     Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains"
     ```
   - **Nginx:** Set the `add_header` directive to enforce HSTS. For example:
     ```
     add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains";
     ```
   - **IIS:** Set the `HSTS` module to enforce HSTS. For example:
     ```
     <system.webServer>
       <security>
         <hsts enabled="true" />
       </security>
     </system.webServer>
     ```

2. **Application-Level Remediation:**
   - **Express.js:** Use the `trust proxy` middleware to enforce HSTS. For example:
     ```javascript
     app.use(require('express').trustProxy());
     ```
   - **PHP:** Use the `apache2handler` module to enforce HSTS. For example:
     ```
     php_value hsts on
     ```
