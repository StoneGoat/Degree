## Scanning in progress

The scan is now running. Results will appear here as they are processed.

### Network Exposure Summary
- The network is exposed to the internet with the following open ports:
  - 22/tcp: SSH

### Open Ports & Services
- 22/tcp: SSH (OpenSSH 5.3p1 Debian 3ubuntu4)

### Security Observations
- The network is exposed to the SSH service, which is known to be vulnerable to multiple exploits, including CVE-2010-5107.

### Recommended Actions
- Update the SSH service to the latest version to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- Implement strong password policies and enforce regular password changes for the SSH service.
- Regularly monitor and audit the network for any suspicious activities related to the SSH service.
- Conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and remediate any additional vulnerabilities.
- Educate users on the importance of security and encourage them to report any suspicious activities related to the SSH service.## nikto_analysis

Based on the Nikto scan results, there are several potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed:

### Issue Explanation
- The anti-clickjacking X-Frame-Options header is not present, which could allow clickjacking attacks.
- The server leaks inodes via ETags, which could be used for fingerprinting and other attacks.
- The application is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in multiple places.

### Impact Analysis
- Clickjacking could trick users into performing actions they did not intend, leading to unauthorized actions.
- ETag leaks could be used to track users across different sites.
- XSS could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.

### Exploitation Details
- Clickjacking could be exploited by embedding the application in an iframe on a malicious site and tricking users into clicking on the malicious site.
- ETag leaks could be exploited by an attacker to track users and potentially hijack sessions.
- XSS could be exploited by injecting scripts that steal cookies or perform other malicious actions.

### Step-by-Step Remediation
1. Implement the X-Frame-Options header to prevent clickjacking.
2. Disable ETag generation in the server configuration.
3. Sanitize and validate all user input to prevent XSS.
4. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
5. Regularly update and patch all software to fix known vulnerabilities.
6. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
