### Nikto Analysis


Based on the Nikto scan results, here's a practical, implementation-focused analysis:

### Issue Explanation
The vulnerability identified by Nikto is related to the server's security headers. Specifically, the server is missing several important security headers that are recommended for secure web applications. The direct security principle being violated is the principle of implementing security headers to protect against common web attacks.

### Impact Analysis
The direct technical consequences of this vulnerability are that the server is not protected against several common web attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and content spoofing. Without these security headers, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to inject malicious scripts, steal sensitive information, or perform other malicious activities.

### Exploitation Details & Proof-of-Concept
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious content that exploits the missing security headers. For example, an attacker could use a script to bypass the Content Security Policy (CSP) header, allowing them to inject malicious scripts into the page.

### Step-by-Step Remediation & Verification
To fix this vulnerability, you need to add the missing security headers to the server configuration. Here's how you can do it on an Apache server:

1. Edit the Apache configuration file (e.g., `httpd.conf` or `.htaccess`).

2. Add the following headers to the configuration:

   ```
   Header set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
   Header set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
   Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src'self'; script-src'self'; object-src 'none';"
   Header set Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
   ```

3. Save the configuration file and restart the Apache server.

To verify that the fix has been successfully implemented, you can check the response headers of a request to the server. The security headers should be present in the response.

### Technical References & Best Practices
- [OWASP Security Headers](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Security_Headers)
- [Mozilla Security Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)
- [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
- [Referrer Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy)

By following these steps and implementing the best practices, you can secure your web server against the vulnerabilities identified by Nikto.

- No known vulnerabilities for OpenSSH 8.2p1.

### Step-by-Step Remediation & Verification
1. Configure security headers and other hardening measures for nginx:
   - Edit the nginx configuration file:
     ```
     sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
     ```

     ```
     server {
       add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY";
       add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
       add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
       add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src'self'; script-src'self'; object-src 'none';";
     }
     ```
   - Restart nginx:
     ```
     sudo service nginx restart
     ```
2. Configure strong authentication and access controls for SSH:
   - Edit the SSH configuration file:
     ```
     sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     ```
   - Add strong authentication and access control directives:
     ```
     PermitRootLogin no
     PasswordAuthentication no
     UsePAM yes
     ```
   - Restart SSH:
     ```
     sudo service ssh restart
     ```
   - Verify SSH configuration:
     ```
     ssh -v
     ```
3. Test and verify the fixes:
   - Re-run Nmap scan to verify open ports and services:
     ```
     nmap -sV 67.57.228.35.bc.googleusercontent.com
     ```
   - Use netcat or telnet to test specific ports and services:
     ```
     nc -v 67.57.228.35.bc.googleusercontent.com 22
     telnet 67.57.228.35.bc.googleusercontent.com 80
     ```
   - Check service status and configuration:
     ```
     service ssh status
     service nginx status
     ```
   - Verify security headers and other hardening measures:
     ```
     curl -I http://67.57.228.35.bc.googleusercontent.com
     ```
   - Check SSH configuration:
     ```
     ssh -v

### Server Leaks Information Via "X-Powered-By" Http Response Header Field(S)

**Issue:**

The vulnerability alert details that the web/application server is leaking information via the "X-Powered-By" HTTP response header field. This header is used to indicate the software or framework that is powering the web application. However, exposing this information can be a security risk because it can help attackers identify other frameworks or components that the application is using, which may have known vulnerabilities.

Common root causes of this issue include:
- Default server configurations that include the "X-Powered-By" header.
- Misconfiguration of server headers in the application code.

The "X-Powered-By" header can be set by various parts of the web stack:
- Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
- Application server (e.g., Tomcat, Node.js)
- Load balancer (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy)

The direct security principle being violated is the principle of least disclosure, as the server is revealing more information than necessary.


**Impact:**

The specific consequences of leaking the "X-Powered-By" header can include:
- Facilitating targeted attacks by revealing the application's technology stack.
- Allowing attackers to identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the exposed frameworks or components.
- Potentially leading to further exploitation of the application.


**Exploit:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the information from the "X-Powered-By" header to:
- Research known vulnerabilities in the identified frameworks or components.
- Craft targeted attacks against the application, knowing the specific technologies it uses.
- Use the information to plan further exploitation efforts.


**Solution:**

To remediate this issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the server configuration that sets the "X-Powered-By" header.
2. Modify the configuration to remove or suppress the "X-Powered-By" header.
3. For application servers, ensure that the application code does not set the "X-Powered-By" header.
4. Verify that the "X-Powered-By" header is no longer present in the HTTP response headers.

For example, in an Apache configuration, you can use the `ServerTokens` directive to suppress the "X-Powered-By" header:

```apache
ServerTokens Prod
```

To verify the fix, you can:
- Use a tool like `curl` to inspect the HTTP response headers and confirm the absence of the "X-Powered-By" header.
- Review the server configuration files to ensure the changes have been applied correctly.
- Monitor the application logs for any signs of the "X-Powered-By" header being set.
