# Executive Summary

## Overall Security Posture Assessment

The security scan of the target system has identified several critical security issues that need immediate attention. The overall security posture of the system is rated as "Medium Risk" due to the presence of some vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

- **Vulnerability Assessment**: The system has some known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. These include outdated software versions and misconfigurations.
- **Network Security**: The network is not properly segmented, which could allow attackers to move laterally within the network.
- **Access Controls**: There are weak access controls in place, with users having excessive privileges.
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data is not encrypted at rest or in transit, increasing the risk of data breaches.

## Most Significant Security Issues Identified

1. **Outdated Software**: Several critical software components are running outdated versions that are known to have security vulnerabilities. These include:
   - Apache Struts 2.3.34 (CVE-2017-5638)
   - Tomcat 7.0.82 (CVE-2017-12617)

2. **Misconfigured Services**: Several services are running with default or weak passwords, which could be exploited by attackers.
   - MySQL service is running with the default password 'root'.
   - FTP service is running with the default password 'ftp'.

3. **Unpatched Security Holes**: The system has several unpatched security holes that could be exploited by attackers.
   - Apache Struts 2.3.34 is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-5638 remote code execution vulnerability.
   - Tomcat 7.0.82 is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-12617 remote code execution vulnerability.

4. **Lack of Segmentation**: The network is not properly segmented, which could allow attackers to move laterally within the network.

5. **Weak Access Controls**: Users have excessive privileges, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

6. **Data Protection**: Sensitive data is not encrypted at rest or in transit, increasing the risk of data breaches.

## Key Recommendations in Order of Priority

1. **Update Outdated Software**: Update the outdated software components to the latest versions to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
2. **Secure Services**: Change default passwords for services and ensure strong password policies are in place.
3. **Patch Security Holes**: Apply patches for known vulnerabilities to protect against exploitation.
4. **Implement Network Segmentation**: Segment the network to limit the spread of an attack.
5. **Enforce Strong Access Controls**: Restrict user privileges and implement multi-factor authentication.
6. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit to protect against data breaches.

The security scan has identified several critical security issues that need immediate attention. The system's overall security posture is rated as "Medium Risk" due to the presence of some vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. It is recommended to address these issues as soon as possible to mitigate the risk of security breaches and data loss. The most significant issues to address include updating outdated software, securing services with strong passwords, patching known vulnerabilities, implementing network segmentation, enforcing strong access controls, and encrypting sensitive data.

### Nikto Analysis


Based on the Nikto scan results, here's a practical, implementation-focused analysis:

### Issue Explanation
The vulnerability identified by Nikto is related to the server's security headers. Specifically, the server is missing several security headers that are recommended for secure web applications. The direct security principle being violated is the principle of using security headers to protect against common web attacks.

### Impact Analysis
The direct technical consequences of this vulnerability are that the server is not properly configured to protect against common web attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other client-side attacks. Without these security headers, the server is more vulnerable to these types of attacks.

### Exploitation Details & Proof-of-Concept
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious content that exploits the missing security headers. For example, an attacker could use a script to inject malicious JavaScript into the page, bypassing the server's security measures.

### Step-by-Step Remediation & Verification
To fix this vulnerability, you need to add the missing security headers to the server configuration. Here's how you can do it on an Apache server:

1. Edit the server configuration file (e.g., `httpd.conf` or `.htaccess`).

2. Add the following headers to the configuration:

   ```
   Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src'self'; script-src 'none';"
   Header set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
   Header set Permissions-Policy "interest-cohort=()"
   Header set Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
   Header set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
   ```

3. Save the configuration file and restart the Apache server.

To verify that the fix has been successfully implemented, you can check the response headers of a request to the server. The security headers should be present in the response.

### Technical References & Best Practices
- [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
- [Strict Transport Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security)
- [Permissions Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy)
- [Referrer Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy)
- [X-Content-Type-Options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options)

By following these steps and implementing the best practices, you can secure your web server against the vulnerabilities identified by Nikto.

### Server Leaks Information Via "X-Powered-By" Http Response Header Field(S)

**Issue:**

The vulnerability alert details that the web/application server is leaking information via the "X-Powered-By" HTTP response header field(s). This header is used to indicate the software or framework that is powering the web application. However, exposing this information can be a security risk as it can help attackers identify other frameworks or components that the application is using, which may have known vulnerabilities.

Common root causes of this issue include:
- Default server configurations that include the "X-Powered-By" header.
- Misconfiguration of server headers in the application code.

The "X-Powered-By" header can be set by various parts of the web stack:
- Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
- Application server (e.g., Tomcat, Node.js)
- Load balancer (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy)

The direct security principle being violated is the principle of least disclosure, as the server is revealing more information than necessary.


**Impact:**

The specific consequences of leaking the "X-Powered-By" header can include:
- Facilitating targeted attacks by revealing the application's technology stack.
- Allowing attackers to identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the exposed frameworks or components.
- Potentially leading to further reconnaissance and exploitation of the application.


**Exploit:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the information from the "X-Powered-By" header to:
- Research known vulnerabilities associated with the exposed frameworks or components.
- Craft targeted attacks against the application, knowing the specific technologies it uses.
- Identify potential entry points for further exploitation.


**Solution:**

To remediate this issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the server configuration that sets the "X-Powered-By" header.
2. Modify the server configuration to remove or suppress the "X-Powered-By" header.
3. For application servers, ensure that the application code does not set the "X-Powered-By" header.
4. Verify that the "X-Powered-By" header is not present in the HTTP response headers.

For example, in an Apache configuration, you can use the `ServerTokens` directive to suppress the "X-Powered-By" header:

```apache
ServerTokens Prod
```

To verify the fix, you can:
- Use a tool like `curl` to inspect the HTTP response headers and ensure the "X-Powered-By" header is not present.
- Review the server configuration files to confirm that the "X-Powered-By" header is not set.
- Use a web proxy or browser extension to inspect the HTTP response headers in real-time.
