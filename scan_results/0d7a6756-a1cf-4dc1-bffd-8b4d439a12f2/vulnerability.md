## Generic Data Update

### Nikto Analysis


### Issue Explanation
Nikto identified a directory listing vulnerability on the web server. Directory listing occurs when a web server returns a listing of files and directories in a directory when a request is made for a directory that does not exist. This can be a security risk because it can reveal sensitive information about the server and its contents.

The root cause of this vulnerability is typically misconfiguration of the web server, such as not setting the `Options` directive to `None` or `Indexes` to `off` in Apache, or not setting the `DirectoryIndex` directive to a specific file in Nginx. This allows the server to return a directory listing by default.

### Impact Analysis
The direct technical consequences of this vulnerability are:
- It allows attackers to discover the structure of the file system, which can reveal sensitive information such as file names, directory structures, and potentially sensitive files.
- It can lead to further exploitation, as attackers can use the information to craft targeted attacks or to find other vulnerabilities.
- It can be used to discover the version of the web server and installed software, which can be used to identify known vulnerabilities.

### Exploitation Details & Proof-of-Concept
An attacker might take the following steps to exploit this vulnerability:
1. Discover the directory listing by making a request to a directory that does not exist.
2. Analyze the directory listing to find sensitive information, such as file names, directory structures, and potentially sensitive files.
3. Use the information to craft targeted attacks or to find other vulnerabilities.

Here is a simple command-line example using `curl` to demonstrate the vulnerability:
```
curl -I http://portfolio.noahsmedberg.com/nonexistent_directory
```
This command sends an HTTP GET request to a non-existent directory and displays the HTTP headers, which may reveal a directory listing if the server is misconfigured.

### Step-by-Step Remediation & Verification
To fix this vulnerability, you need to configure the web server to prevent directory listings. Here are the steps for Nginx:

1. Open the Nginx configuration file (e.g., `nginx.conf`).
2. Add the following lines to the configuration:
   ```
   location / {
       index index.html index.htm;
       try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
   }
   ```
   This configuration sets the `index` directive to specific files and uses `try_files` to handle requests for non-existent files.
3. Save the configuration file and restart the Nginx server.
4. To verify the fix, make a request to a non-existent directory and check if the server returns a 404 Not Found error instead of a directory listing.
