## Generic Data Update

### Nikto Analysis


### Issue Explanation
Nikto identified that the web server is using the Templ.io web framework, which is a known outdated and potentially vulnerable framework. The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of an outdated and unsupported framework that may have known security issues.

### Impact Analysis
The direct technical consequences of using an outdated framework are:
- It exposes the server to known vulnerabilities that have been discovered and patched in newer versions of the framework.
- It may lead to exploitation of the server, as attackers can use known exploits against the outdated framework.
- It can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the web application.

### Exploitation Details & Proof-of-Concept
An attacker might take the following steps to exploit this vulnerability:
1. Research known vulnerabilities associated with the outdated Templ.io framework.
2. Identify and use exploits that target the known vulnerabilities.
3. Gain unauthorized access to the server, steal data, or disrupt the service.

Here is a simple command-line example using `curl` to demonstrate the vulnerability:
```
curl -I https://www.flamman.se/
```
This command sends an HTTP GET request to the server and displays the HTTP headers, which may reveal the use of the Templ.io framework.

### Step-by-Step Remediation & Verification
To fix this vulnerability, you need to update the web framework to a newer, supported version. Here are the steps:

1. Research the latest version of Templ.io and its security updates.
2. Download and install the latest version of Templ.io.
3. Update the web application to use the new version of Templ.io.
4. Test the updated application to ensure it functions correctly.
5. Verify the fix by checking the server headers to ensure they no longer indicate the use of Templ.io.

## Generic Data Update

### Server Leaks Information Via "X-Powered-By" Http Response Header Field(S)

**Issue:**

The vulnerability alert details that the web/application server is leaking information via the "X-Powered-By" HTTP response header field(s). This header is used to indicate the software or framework that is powering the web application. However, exposing this information can be a security risk as it can help attackers identify other frameworks or components that the application is using, which may have known vulnerabilities.

Common root causes of this issue include:
- Default server configurations that include the "X-Powered-By" header.
- Misconfiguration of server headers in the application code.

The "X-Powered-By" header can be set in various parts of the web stack:
- Web server: If the web server sends the header by default.
- Application server: If the application server sends the header by default.
- Load balancer: If the load balancer sends the header by default.

The direct security principle being violated is the principle of least disclosure, as the server is revealing more information than necessary.


**Impact:**

The specific consequences of leaking the "X-Powered-By" header can include:
- Facilitating targeted attacks by revealing the application's technology stack.
- Allowing attackers to identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the identified frameworks or components.
- Potentially leading to further exploitation of the application.


**Exploit:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the information from the "X-Powered-By" header to:
- Research known vulnerabilities associated with the identified frameworks or components.
- Craft targeted attacks against the application, knowing the specific technologies it uses.


**Solution:**

To remediate this issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the server configuration that sends the "X-Powered-By" header.
2. Disable the sending of the "X-Powered-By" header in the server configuration.
3. If the header is set in the application code, remove or modify the code to stop sending the header.

For example, in an Apache configuration, you can use the `ServerTokens` directive to suppress the "X-Powered-By" header:

```apache
ServerTokens Prod
```

This configuration sets the server tokens to "Prod", which suppresses the "X-Powered-By" header.

To verify the fix, you can:
- Check the HTTP response headers to ensure the "X-Powered-By" header is no longer present.
- Use a tool like `curl` to inspect the headers:
  ```
  curl -I http://example.com
  ```
- Review the server configuration files to ensure the "X-Powered-By" header is not set.

## Generic Data Update

### Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set

**Issue:**

The vulnerability alert details that the web server is not enforcing HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). HSTS is a security policy mechanism that ensures that a web application is accessed only over HTTPS, providing protection against man-in-the-middle attacks and other vulnerabilities.

Common root causes of this issue include:
- Lack of configuration of the HSTS header in the server.
- Misconfiguration of the HSTS header in the application code.

The HSTS header can be set in various parts of the web stack:
- Web server: If the web server is not configured to send the HSTS header.
- Application server: If the application server is not configured to send the HSTS header.
- Load balancer: If the load balancer is not configured to send the HSTS header.

The direct security principle being violated is the principle of secure communication, as the server is not enforcing the use of HTTPS.


**Impact:**

The specific consequences of not enforcing HSTS can include:
- Man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker intercepts and possibly alters the communication between the client and the server.
- Downgrade attacks, where an attacker forces the client to use HTTP instead of HTTPS.
- Potential exposure of sensitive information in transit.


**Exploit:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by:
- Intercepting the communication between the client and the server.
- Performing a man-in-the-middle attack to downgrade the connection to HTTP.
- Capturing sensitive information transmitted over HTTP.


**Solution:**

To remediate this issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the server configuration that is not enforcing HSTS.
2. Configure the server to send the HSTS header with a max-age directive that specifies the duration for which the HSTS policy should be enforced.
3. If the HSTS header is set in the application code, ensure it is properly configured.

For example, in an Apache configuration, you can use the `Header` directive to enforce HSTS:

```apache
Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
```

This configuration sets the HSTS header with a max-age of 1 year and includes subdomains.

To verify the fix, you can:
- Check the HTTP response headers to ensure the HSTS header is present and correctly configured.
- Use a tool like `curl` to inspect the headers:
  ```
  curl -I https://example.com
  ```
- Review the server configuration files to ensure the HSTS header is properly set.

- OWASP Top 10: A2017-A2:2017 - Broken Authentication: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017-A2-Broken_Authentication

By following these steps and best practices, you can effectively enforce HSTS and improve the security of your web applications.
