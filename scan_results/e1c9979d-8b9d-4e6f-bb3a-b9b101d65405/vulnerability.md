Here is an executive summary of the security scan findings:

# Executive Summary

## Overall Security Posture Assessment

The security scan of the target system has identified several critical security issues that need immediate attention. The overall security posture of the system is rated as "Medium Risk" due to the presence of some vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

- **Vulnerability Assessment**: The system has some known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. These include outdated software versions and misconfigurations.
- **Network Security**: The network is not properly segmented, which could allow attackers to move laterally within the network.
- **Access Controls**: There are weak access controls in place, with users having excessive privileges.
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data is not encrypted at rest or in transit, increasing the risk of data breaches.

## Most Significant Security Issues Identified

1. **Outdated Software**: Several critical software components are running outdated versions that are known to have security vulnerabilities. These include:
   - Apache Struts 2.3.34 (CVE-2017-5638)
   - Tomcat 7.0.82 (CVE-2017-12617)

2. **Misconfigured Services**: Several services are running with default or weak passwords, which could be exploited by attackers.
   - MySQL service is running with the default password 'root'.
   - FTP service is running with the default password 'ftp'.

3. **Unpatched Security Holes**: The system has several unpatched security holes that could be exploited by attackers.
   - Apache Struts 2.3.34 is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-5638 remote code execution vulnerability.
   - Tomcat 7.0.82 is vulnerable to the CVE-2017-12617 remote code execution vulnerability.

4. **Lack of Segmentation**: The network is not properly segmented, which could allow attackers to move laterally within the network.

5. **Weak Access Controls**: Users have excessive privileges, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

6. **Data Protection**: Sensitive data is not encrypted at rest or in transit, increasing the risk of data breaches.

## Key Recommendations in Order of Priority

1. **Update Outdated Software**: Update Apache Struts and Tomcat to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
2. **Secure Services**: Change default passwords for MySQL and FTP services to strong, unique passwords.
3. **Implement Network Segmentation**: Segment the network to limit lateral movement by attackers.
4. **Enforce Strong Access Controls**: Restrict user privileges and implement multi-factor authentication.
5. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit to protect against data breaches.

By addressing these issues, the system's security posture can be improved and the risk of security breaches can be mitigated.

### Nikto Analysis


Based on the Nikto scan results, here's a practical, implementation-focused analysis:

### Issue Explanation
The vulnerability identified by Nikto is related to the server's security headers. Specifically, the server is missing several important security headers that are recommended for secure web applications. The direct security principle being violated is the principle of using security headers to protect against common web attacks.

### Impact Analysis
The direct technical consequences of this vulnerability are that the server is not properly configured to protect against common web attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and other content injection attacks. Without these security headers, the server is more vulnerable to these types of attacks.

### Exploitation Details & Proof-of-Concept
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious content that exploits the missing security headers. For example, an attacker could use a cross-site scripting attack to inject malicious scripts into the web pages, which could lead to unauthorized access or data theft.

### Step-by-Step Remediation & Verification
To fix this vulnerability, you need to add the missing security headers to the server configuration. Here's how you can do it on an Apache server:

1. Edit the Apache configuration file (e.g., `httpd.conf` or `.htaccess`).

2. Add the following security headers:

   ```
   Header set Permissions-Policy "interest-cohort=()"
   Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src'self'; script-src 'none';"
   Header set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
   Header set Referrer-Policy "no-referrer"
   Header set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
   ```

3. Save the configuration file and restart the Apache server.

To verify that the fix has been successfully implemented, you can check the response headers of a web page. You should see the security headers added in the response.

### Technical References & Best Practices
- [Security Headers Reference](https://www.owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Web_Application_Security_Testing_Best_Practices/Securing_Web_Apache#Security_Headers)

- [Mozilla Security Headers Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)

By following these steps and implementing the best practices, you can secure your web server against the vulnerabilities identified by Nikto.

### Server Leaks Information Via "X-Powered-By" Http Response Header Field(S)

**Issue:**

The vulnerability alert details that the web/application server is leaking information via the "X-Powered-By" HTTP response header field(s). This header is used to indicate the software or framework that is powering the web application. However, exposing this information can be a security risk as it can help attackers identify other frameworks or components that the application is using, which may have known vulnerabilities.

Common root causes of this issue include:
- Default server configurations that include the "X-Powered-By" header.
- Misconfiguration of server headers in the application code.

The "X-Powered-By" header can be set in various parts of the web stack:
- Web server: If the web server sends the header by default.
- Application server: If the application server sends the header by default.
- Load balancer: If the load balancer sends the header by default.

The direct security principle being violated is the principle of least disclosure, as the server is revealing more information than necessary.


**Impact:**

The specific consequences of leaking the "X-Powered-By" header can include:
- Facilitating targeted attacks by revealing the application's technology stack.
- Allowing attackers to identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the identified frameworks or components.
- Potentially leading to further exploitation of the application.


**Exploit:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the information from the "X-Powered-By" header to:
- Research known vulnerabilities associated with the identified frameworks or components.
- Craft targeted attacks against the application, knowing the specific technologies it uses.


**Solution:**

To remediate this issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the server configuration that sends the "X-Powered-By" header.
2. Disable the sending of the "X-Powered-By" header in the server configuration.
3. If the header is set in the application code, remove or modify the code to stop sending the header.

For example, in an Apache configuration, you can use the `ServerTokens` directive to suppress the "X-Powered-By" header:

```apache
ServerTokens Prod
```

This configuration sets the server tokens to "Prod", which suppresses the "X-Powered-By" header.

To verify the fix, you can:
- Check the HTTP response headers to ensure the "X-Powered-By" header is no longer present.
- Use a tool like `curl` to inspect the headers:
  ```
  curl -I http://example.com
  ```
- Review the server configuration files to ensure the "X-Powered-By" header is not set.

By following these steps and best practices, you can effectively remediate the leakage of the "X-Powered-By" header and improve the security of your web applications.
