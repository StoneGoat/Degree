## Generic Data Update

### Absence Of Anti-Csrf Tokens

**Issue:**

The vulnerability alert details that the application is missing anti-CSRF tokens. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks exploit the trust that a site has in a user's browser.

Common root causes of this issue include:
- Lack of proper CSRF protection in the application.
- Insecure use of forms and URLs in the application.

The CSRF token can be set in various parts of the web stack:
- Application code: If the application code does not generate and validate CSRF tokens.
- Frameworks: If the framework does not provide CSRF protection.

The direct security principle being violated is the principle of least privilege, as the application may allow unauthorized actions to be performed.


**Impact:**

The specific consequences of missing CSRF tokens can include:
- Unauthorized actions being performed by an attacker on behalf of a legitimate user.
- Data manipulation or deletion.
- Account takeover or privilege escalation.


**Exploit:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by:
- Crafting a malicious web page or email that contains a form or link to a URL that triggers an action on the application.
- Tricking a user into visiting the malicious page or clicking the link.
- The application executing the action without proper authentication checks, leading to unauthorized actions.


**Solution:**

To remediate this issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify all forms and URLs that could be used for CSRF attacks.
2. Generate a unique CSRF token for each form or URL.
3. Include the CSRF token in the form or URL.
4. Validate the CSRF token upon form submission or URL access.

For example, in an application code, you can use a CSRF protection library to generate and validate tokens:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string
from flask_wtf.csrf import CSRFProtect

app = Flask(__name__)
CSRFProtect(app)

@app.route('/form', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def form():
    if request.method == 'POST':


**Reference:**

if not CSRFProtect.validate_csrf(request):
            return 'CSRF token validation failed', 403
