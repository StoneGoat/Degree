### Nikto Analysis


### Issue Explanation
Nikto identified a directory listing vulnerability on the web server. Directory listing occurs when a web server returns a listing of files and directories in a directory when a request is made for a directory that does not exist. This can be a security risk because it can reveal sensitive information about the server and its contents.

The root cause of this vulnerability is typically misconfiguration of the web server, such as not setting the `Options` directive to `None` or `Indexes` to `off` in Apache, or not setting the `DirectoryIndex` directive to a specific file in Nginx. This allows the server to return a directory listing by default.

### Impact Analysis
The direct technical consequences of this vulnerability are:
- It allows attackers to discover the structure of the file system, which can reveal sensitive information such as file names, directory structures, and potentially sensitive files.
- It can lead to further exploitation, as attackers can use the information to craft targeted attacks or to find other vulnerabilities.
- It can be used to discover the version of the web server and installed software, which can be used to identify known vulnerabilities.

### Exploitation Details & Proof-of-Concept
An attacker might take the following steps to exploit this vulnerability:
1. Discover the directory listing by making a request to a directory that does not exist.
2. Analyze the directory listing to find sensitive information, such as file names, directory structures, and potentially sensitive files.
3. Use the information to craft targeted attacks or to find other vulnerabilities.

Here is a simple command-line example using `curl` to demonstrate the vulnerability:
```
curl -I http://portfolio.noahsmedberg.com/nonexistent_directory
```
This command sends an HTTP GET request to a non-existent directory and displays the HTTP headers, which may reveal a directory listing if the server is misconfigured.

### Step-by-Step Remediation & Verification
To fix this vulnerability, you need to configure the web server to prevent directory listings. Here are the steps for Nginx:

1. Open the Nginx configuration file (e.g., `nginx.conf`).
2. Add the following lines to the configuration:
   ```
   location / {
       index index.html index.htm;
       try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
   }
   ```
   This configuration sets the `index` directive to specific files and uses `try_files` to handle requests for non-existent files.
3. Save the configuration file and restart the Nginx server.
4. To verify the fix, make a request to a non-existent directory and check if the server returns a 404 Not Found error instead of a directory listing.

### Absence Of Anti-Csrf Tokens

**Issue:**

The vulnerability alert details that the application is missing anti-CSRF tokens. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks exploit the trust that a site has in a user's browser.

Common root causes of this issue include:
- Lack of proper CSRF protection in the application.
- Insecure use of forms and URLs in the application.

The CSRF token can be set in various parts of the web stack:
- Application code: If the application code does not generate and validate CSRF tokens.
- Frameworks: If the framework does not provide CSRF protection.

The direct security principle being violated is the principle of least privilege, as the application may allow unauthorized actions to be performed.


**Impact:**

The specific consequences of missing CSRF tokens can include:
- Unauthorized actions being performed by an attacker on behalf of a legitimate user.
- Data manipulation or deletion.
- Account takeover or privilege escalation.


**Exploit:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by:
- Crafting a malicious web page or email that contains a form or link to a URL that triggers an action on the application.
- Tricking a user into visiting the malicious page or clicking the link.
- The application executing the action without proper authentication checks, leading to unauthorized actions.


**Solution:**

To remediate this issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify all forms and URLs that could be used for CSRF attacks.
2. Generate a unique CSRF token for each form or URL.
3. Include the CSRF token in the form or URL.
4. Validate the CSRF token upon form submission or URL access.

For example, in an application code, you can use a CSRF protection library to generate and validate tokens:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string
from flask_wtf.csrf import CSRFProtect

app = Flask(__name__)
CSRFProtect(app)

@app.route('/form', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def form():
    if request.method == 'POST':


**Reference:**

if not CSRFProtect.validate_csrf(request):
            return 'CSRF token validation failed', 403

### Server Leaks Version Information Via "Server" Http Response Header Field

**Issue:**

The vulnerability alert details that the web/application server is leaking version information via the "Server" HTTP response header. This information can be used by attackers to identify other vulnerabilities that the server may be susceptible to. For example, if an attacker knows the version of a specific web server, they can search for known vulnerabilities that affect that version.

Common root causes of this issue include:
- Default server configurations that expose version information
- Lack of configuration to suppress sensitive headers
- Misconfiguration of web server software

The "Server" header typically occurs in the backend, as it is a server-side header that is set by the web server software.

The direct security principle being violated is the principle of least disclosure, as the server is revealing more information than necessary.


**Impact:**

The specific consequences of leaking version information include:
- Facilitating targeted attacks by allowing attackers to identify specific versions of software that are vulnerable to known exploits.
- Revealing information that can be used to craft more effective phishing or social engineering attacks.
- Potentially exposing sensitive information about the server environment and its configuration.


**Exploit:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by:
1. Sending a request to the server.
2. Analyzing the response headers to identify the version information.
3. Searching for known vulnerabilities that affect the identified version.

For example, an attacker could use a tool like `curl` to send a request and view the response headers:

```bash
curl -I http://example.com
```

The response might include a "Server" header like:

```
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
```

The attacker could then search for known vulnerabilities affecting Apache 2.4.7.


**Solution:**

To remediate this issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the server software and version.
2. Check the server configuration to see if the "Server" header is suppressed or if it provides generic details.
3. If the "Server" header is not suppressed, configure the server to do so.
4. For Apache, you can use the `ServerTokens` directive to set the "Server" header to a generic value:

```apache
ServerTokens Prod
```

5. For Nginx, you can use the `server_tokens` directive to set the "Server" header to a generic value:

```nginx
server_tokens off;
```

6. Verify the fix by sending a request to the server and checking if the "Server" header is no longer present or if it provides generic information.

### Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set

**Issue:**

The vulnerability alert details that the web server is not enforcing HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). HSTS is a security policy mechanism that ensures that a web server communicates with clients over HTTPS only, even if the initial connection is made over HTTP.

Common root causes of this issue include:
- Lack of configuration to enforce HSTS
- Misconfiguration of web server software
- Inadequate security settings in the web server

HSTS typically occurs in the backend, as it is a server-side policy that is enforced by the web server.

The direct security principle being violated is the principle of secure communication, as the server is not ensuring that all communication is encrypted.


**Impact:**

The specific consequences of not enforcing HSTS include:
- Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker intercepts and decrypts the traffic.
- Exposure of sensitive information in transit.
- Lack of protection against downgrade attacks, where an attacker forces the connection to use HTTP instead of HTTPS.


**Exploit:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by:
1. Intercepting the initial HTTP connection to the server.
2. Redirecting the user to a malicious site that mimics the legitimate site.
3. Performing a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept and decrypt the traffic.

For example, an attacker could use a tool like `mitmproxy` to intercept and decrypt HTTP traffic:

```bash
mitmproxy -s "redirect -p 80:443" -p 80:443
```


**Solution:**

To remediate this issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the web server and application server.
2. Check the server configuration to see if HSTS is enforced.
3. If HSTS is not enforced, configure the server to enforce it.
4. For Apache, you can use the `Header` directive to set the HSTS header:

```apache
Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains"
```

5. For Nginx, you can use the `add_header` directive to set the HSTS header:

```nginx
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains";
```

6. Verify the fix by sending a request to the server and checking if the HSTS header is present and has the expected value.
