        "Server Leaks Information via \"X-Powered-By\" HTTP Response Header Field(s)": {
            "issue": "The vulnerability alert details indicate that the web/application server is leaking information via the \"X-Powered-By\" HTTP response header field(s). This header is used to indicate the software or framework that is powering the web application. However, exposing this information can be a security risk because it can help attackers identify other frameworks or components that the application is reliant upon, which may have known vulnerabilities.",
            "impact": "The potential risks and security impact if this vulnerability is exploited include:\n- **Vulnerability Identification:** Attackers can identify the specific web server, application server, or framework that the application is using, which can lead to the discovery of known vulnerabilities associated with those components.\n- **Targeted Attacks:** Attackers can tailor their attacks to exploit known vulnerabilities in the identified components.\n- **Information Disclosure:** The exposed information can be used to gather more information about the application, its architecture, and potential attack vectors.",
            "exploit": "An attacker might exploit this vulnerability by:\n1. Identifying the \"X-Powered-By\" header in the HTTP response.\n2. Using the information to research known vulnerabilities associated with the identified components.\n3. Crafting targeted attacks or exploits based on the identified vulnerabilities.",
            "solution": "To mitigate or resolve the issue, follow these steps:\n1. **Configure Server Headers:** Ensure that the web server, application server, or load balancer is configured to suppress the \"X-Powered-By\" header. This can be done through server configuration files or using server-side scripting.\n2. **Use Custom Headers:** If necessary, use custom headers to provide information about the application or server, but ensure they do not disclose sensitive information.\n3. **Regular Updates:** Keep all software components up to date with the latest security patches and updates to mitigate known vulnerabilities.\n4. **Security Testing:** Regularly conduct security testing, including penetration testing and code reviews, to identify and fix vulnerabilities.\n5. **Security Policies:** Establish and enforce security policies and procedures to prevent information leakage and other security threats.",

            "issue": "The vulnerability alert details indicate that the HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header is not set. HSTS is a web security policy mechanism that ensures that web browsers interact with a web server using only secure HTTPS connections. This helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and other forms of eavesdropping.",
            "impact": "The potential risks and security impact if this vulnerability is exploited include:\n- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Attackers can intercept and potentially alter the communication between the client and the server, leading to data interception and manipulation.\n- **Eavesdropping:** Attackers can eavesdrop on the communication, capturing sensitive information such as login credentials, personal data, or confidential documents.\n- **Downgrade Attacks:** Attackers can force the client to use HTTP instead of HTTPS, potentially allowing them to intercept and manipulate the communication.",
            "exploit": "An attacker might exploit this vulnerability by:\n1. Intercepting the communication between the client and the server.\n2. Forcing the client to use HTTP instead of HTTPS, either through a man-in-the-middle attack or by exploiting other vulnerabilities.\n3. Capturing sensitive information or manipulating the communication.",
            "solution": "To mitigate or resolve the issue, follow these steps:\n1. **Configure HSTS:** Ensure that the web server, application server, or load balancer is configured to enforce HSTS. This can be done through server configuration files or using server-side scripting.\n2. **Set HSTS Policy:** Set the HSTS policy with a long duration (e.g., 1 year) and include the \"includeSubDomains\" and \"preload\" directives to enforce HSTS across all subdomains and to instruct browsers to preload the HSTS policy.\n3. **Regular Updates:** Keep all software components up to date with the latest security patches and updates to mitigate known vulnerabilities.\n4. **Security Testing:** Regularly conduct security testing, including penetration testing and code reviews, to identify and fix vulnerabilities.\n5. **Security Policies:** Establish and enforce security policies and procedures to prevent security threats and ensure the secure use of HTTPS.",
